# sgRNA_Annotator
An Excel-based tool to download the RefSeq genbank file for a given Human or Mouse gene and annotate CRISPR sgRNAs from literature. 

Goals:

Genome wide sgRNA libraries designed for gene knockout were collected from studies listed below and organized in a database. 

A Macro containing Excel workbook developed to search the database for sgRNAs designed for a given Human or Mouse gene.

The Excel codes are linked to control buttons in the spreadsheet graphical inteface, so no programming skill is required.

A user can either annotate sgRNAs on his/her genbank file, or directly use the button to download the RefSeq from NCBI and annotate sgRNAs.

Excel codes can recognize sgRNA pairs and calculate the distance between two cut sites. Possible dual-sgRNAs with user-specified distances will be shortlisted.

Deletions resulting from combination of dual-sgRNAs are listed as inFrame / FrameShift.

A button is provided for update purposes, then a user can occasionaly check for the updates.

Enjoy using it :)
